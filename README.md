# 3D-Voronoi-Diagram-generation-code-using-modified-MPS
- Voronoi models were generated using n seeds in unit cube.
- Voronoi seeds were generated using [Modified MPS](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~samitch/papers/cccg-present.pdf) for regularity less than 80%.
- Voronoi seeds were generated using [Simple MPS by Implicit Quad-Trees](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-44900-4_13) for regularity higher than 80%.
- For every regularity and relative density, 20 models were generated by a different random distribution of seeds. 
- These combinations generated 300 models.
- This C++ code was developed to generate these models automatically.
- This program encapsulates [TetGen library](http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/) to get Voronoi cells.
